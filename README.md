# Show And Tell

This is a fun tool that uses Google's API to show a result and
image related to the search query. This tool can be used when trying to "show and tell"
someone about a topic.

It is done in vanilla javascript and uses asynchronous programming in order to update
the page without re-rendering it.

## Requirements

A curious mind that would like to search a topic to seek photos and information about it.
